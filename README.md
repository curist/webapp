# Hello Webapp

Basic boilerplate for mithril.js app using webpack.


## Development

```sh
npm i
npm start
# open http://localhost:8080
```

## Build

```sh
npm i
npm run build
# bundled app sits in ./build/
```

# App Architecture

1. [mithril.js][1]: view layer, and other goodies
2. [EventEmitter][2]: event dispatcher
3. [Baobab][3]: Single data store

We are using flux-alike architecture, views can emit events, ask to do actions, and only actions can actually alter db states.

Views use db.BindData to get informed data updates.
